<p>DESCRIPTION
</p>
<p><pre>       This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
       commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content
       with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       The &#39;index&#39; holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next
       commit. Thus after making any changes to the working directory, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command
       to add any new or modified files to the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add
       command is run&#59; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run git add again to add the new content
       to the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       The git status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next commit.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       The git add command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line, git
       add will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git
       (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git add command can be used to add ignored files with the &#45;f
       (force) option.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       Please see git&#45;commit(1) for alternative ways to add content to a commit.
</pre>
</p>

<p>OPTIONS
</p>
<p><pre>       &lt;filepattern&gt;...
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  &#42;.c) can be given to add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.
           dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to add all files in the directory, recursively.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;n, &#45;&#45;dry&#45;run
           Do not actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;v, &#45;&#45;verbose
          Be verbose.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;f, &#45;&#45;force
           Allow adding otherwise ignored files.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;i, &#45;&#45;interactive
           Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to the index. Optional path arguments may be supplied to limit operation
           to a subset of the working tree. See &#39;Interactive mode&#39; for details.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;p, &#45;&#45;patch
           Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance
           to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           This effectively runs add &#45;&#45;interactive, but bypasses the initial command menu and directly jumps to the patch subcommand. See
           &#39;Interactive mode&#39; for details.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;e, &#45;&#45;edit
           Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers and
           apply the patch to the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           NOTE&#58; Obviously, if you change anything else than the first character on lines beginning with a space or a minus, the patch will
           no longer apply.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;u, &#45;&#45;update
           Only match &lt;filepattern&gt; against already tracked files in the index rather than the working tree. That means that it will never
           stage new files, but that it will stage modified new contents of tracked files and that it will remove files from the index if
           the corresponding files in the working tree have been removed.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           If no &lt;filepattern&gt; is given, default to &#39;.&#39;&#59; in other words, update all tracked files in the current directory and its
           subdirectories.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;A, &#45;&#45;all
           Like &#45;u, but match &lt;filepattern&gt; against files in the working tree in addition to the index. That means that it will find new
           files as well as staging modified content and removing files that are no longer in the working tree.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;N, &#45;&#45;intent&#45;to&#45;add
           Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is
           useful for, among other things, showing the unstaged content of such files with git diff and committing them with git commit &#45;a.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;&#45;refresh
           Do not add the file(s), but only refresh their stat() information in the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;&#45;ignore&#45;errors
           If some files could not be added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the operation, but continue adding the others.
           The command shall still exit with non&#45;zero status.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;&#45;ignore&#45;missing
           This option can only be used together with &#45;&#45;dry&#45;run. By using this option the user can check if any of the given files would be
           ignored, no matter if they are already present in the work tree or not.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       &#45;&#45;
           This option can be used to separate command&#45;line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for
           command&#45;line options).
</pre>
</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION
</p>
<p><pre>       The optional configuration variable core.excludesfile indicates a path to a file containing patterns of file names to exclude from
       git&#45;add, similar to $GIT_DIR/info/exclude. Patterns in the exclude file are used in addition to those in info/exclude. See
       gitrepository&#45;layout(5).
</pre>
</p>

<p>EXAMPLES
</p>
<p><pre>         Adds content from all &#42;.txt files under Documentation directory and its subdirectories&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>               $ git add Documentation/&#42;.txt
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           Note that the asterisk &#42; is quoted from the shell in this example&#59; this lets the command include the files from subdirectories
           of Documentation/ directory.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>          Considers adding content from all git&#45;&#42;.sh scripts&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>               $ git add git&#45;&#42;.sh
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not consider
           subdir/git&#45;foo.sh.
</pre>
</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE MODE
</p>
<p><pre>       When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the output of the status subcommand, and then goes into its interactive
       command loop.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a prompt &#39;What now&gt; &#39;. In general, when the prompt ends with a
       single &gt;, you can pick only one of the choices given and type return, like this&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>               &#42;&#42;&#42; Commands &#42;&#42;&#42;
                 1&#58; status       2&#58; update       3&#58; revert       4&#58; add untracked
                 5&#58; patch        6&#58; diff         7&#58; quit         8&#58; help
               What now&gt; 1
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       You also could say s or sta or status above as long as the choice is unique.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       The main command loop has 6 subcommands (plus help and quit).
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       status
           This shows the change between HEAD and index (i.e. what will be committed if you say git commit), and between index and working
           tree files (i.e. what you could stage further before git commit using git add) for each path. A sample output looks like this&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>                             staged     unstaged path
                    1&#58;       binary      nothing foo.png
                    2&#58;     +403/&#45;35        +1/&#45;1 git&#45;add&#45;&#45;interactive.perl
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           It shows that foo.png has differences from HEAD (but that is binary so line count cannot be shown) and there is no difference
           between indexed copy and the working tree version (if the working tree version were also different, binary would have been shown
           in place of nothing). The other file, git&#45;add&#45;&#45;interactive.perl, has 403 lines added and 35 lines deleted if you commit what is
           in the index, but working tree file has further modifications (one addition and one deletion).
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       update
           This shows the status information and issues an &#39;Update&gt;&gt;&#39; prompt. When the prompt ends with double &gt;&gt;, you can make more than
           one selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. &#39;2&#45;5 7,9&#39; to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the
           list. If the second number in a range is omitted, all remaining patches are taken. E.g. &#39;7&#45;&#39; to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You
           can say &#42; to choose everything.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           What you chose are then highlighted with &#42;, like this&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>                          staged     unstaged path
                 1&#58;       binary      nothing foo.png
               &#42; 2&#58;     +403/&#45;35        +1/&#45;1 git&#45;add&#45;&#45;interactive.perl
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           To remove selection, prefix the input with &#45; like this&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>               Update&gt;&gt; &#45;2
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           After making the selection, answer with an empty line to stage the contents of working tree files for selected paths in the
           index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       revert
           This has a very similar UI to update, and the staged information for selected paths are reverted to that of the HEAD version.
           Reverting new paths makes them untracked.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       add untracked
           This has a very similar UI to update and revert, and lets you add untracked paths to the index.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       patch
           This lets you choose one path out of a status like selection. After choosing the path, it presents the diff between the index
           and the working tree file and asks you if you want to stage the change of each hunk. You can say&#58;
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>               y &#45; stage this hunk
               n &#45; do not stage this hunk
               q &#45; quit&#59; do not stage this hunk nor any of the remaining ones
               a &#45; stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
               d &#45; do not stage this hunk nor any of the later hunks in the file
               g &#45; select a hunk to go to
               / &#45; search for a hunk matching the given regex
               j &#45; leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
               J &#45; leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
               k &#45; leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
               K &#45; leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
               s &#45; split the current hunk into smaller hunks
               e &#45; manually edit the current hunk
               ? &#45; print help
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>           After deciding the fate for all hunks, if there is any hunk that was chosen, the index is updated with the selected hunks.
</pre>
</p>


<p><pre>       diff
           This lets you review what will be committed (i.e. between HEAD and index).
</pre>
