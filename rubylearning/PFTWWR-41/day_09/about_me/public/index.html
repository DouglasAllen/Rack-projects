    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Douglas, but some people call me Doug.</p>

    <p>I'm an Extra-Class Amateur Radio Operator and I live in De Kalb Illinois.</p>
    <p>My station call is KB9AGT. I am listed on qrz.com/db/kb9agt.(click the image)</br>
    Yes, we call them hams so it is not offensive to do so.
    <p>I've been trying to learn Ruby in the intention of gaining some </br>
    experience for building my first web page to hook up to a CouchDB server.</p>
    <p>I don't believe the hype that Rails is dead either. It's being used and embraced everywhere.</p>
    <p>Rails is just not the new kid on the block anymore. So who is the new kid in town? lol</p>
    <p>That's just some more blog material and I 'm trying not to rant these days about things I know less about.</p>
    <p>But my rantings and mussings may be found at <a href="http://nepomuker.blogspot.com">blogger.com</a>.  </p>
    <p>I did take an online <a href="http://www.javapassion.com/portal/images/certificates/javase/session5/DouglasGAllen.pdf">Java course</a> and I completed both beginner and advanced. </p>
    <p>Then I completed a <a href="http://www.javapassion.com/portal/images/certificates/javaee/session14/DouglasGAllen.pdf">Web J2EE course</a> also.</p> 
    <p>I also want to enhance the skills that I picked up in those courses for web page developement.</p>
