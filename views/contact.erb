    <h1>District 71 - Where our Group's GSRs Meet Once A Month...</h1>
       	  <h2>General Service Representative — G.S.R.</h2>
       	  <span class="span_lh"><br />
       	  “The general service representative has the job of linking his or her group with A.A. as a whole. The G.S.R. represents the voice of the group conscience, reporting the group’s thoughts to the district committee member and to the delegate, who passes them on to the Conference. This communication is a two-way street, making the G.S.R. responsible for bringing back to the group Conference Actions that affect A.A. unity, health, and growth. Only when a G.S.R. keeps the group informed, and communicates the group conscience, can the Conference truly act for A.A. as a whole.”<br />
