						whether you think it can help you</h2>
					<span class="span_lh"><br /> We who are in A.A. came
						because we finally gave up trying to control our drinking. We
						still hated to admit that we could never drink safely. Then we
						heard from other A.A. members that we were sick. (We thought so
						for years!) We found out that many people suffered from the same
						feelings of guilt and loneliness and hopelessness that we did. We
						found out that we had these feelings because we had the disease of
						alcoholism.<br /> We decided to try and face up to what alcohol
						had done to us. Here are some of the <a
						href="http://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/is-aa-for-you-twelve-questions-only-you-can-answer">questions</a> we
						tried to answer honestly. If we answered YES to four or more
						questions, we were in deep trouble with our drinking. See how you
						do. Remember, there is no disgrace in facing up to the fact that
						you have a problem.<br /> </span>
					<h1>What is Alcoholics Anonymous</h1>
					<img src="images/books.png" class="phot" alt="" />Alcoholics
					Anonymous® is a fellowship of men and women who share their
					experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve
					their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
					The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
					There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting
					through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect,
					denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish
					to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any
					causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other
					alcoholics to achieve sobriety.>Copyright © by <a

			<h1>District 71 - Where our Group's GSRs Meet Once A Month...</h1>
			<h2>General Service Representative — G.S.R.</h2>
			<span class="span_lh"><br /> “The general service
				representative has the job of linking his or her group with A.A. as
				a whole. The G.S.R. represents the voice of the group conscience,
				reporting the group’s thoughts to the district committee member and
				to the delegate, who passes them on to the Conference. This
				communication is a two-way street, making the G.S.R. responsible for
				bringing back to the group Conference Actions that affect A.A.
				unity, health, and growth. Only when a G.S.R. keeps the group
				informed, and communicates the group conscience, can the Conference
				truly act for A.A. as a whole.”<br /> <br /> – The A.A. Service
				Manual, p. S26</span>
